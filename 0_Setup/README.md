# OpenPilot Setup Guide

This guide includes folders for each of the [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) installation guide. Specifically we have listed the three versions of [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) we used below:


## Working Versions

* [2022_04](./2022_04/README.md) - This contains the installation guide for version `0.8.14` from a commit in April 2022.
* [2022_07](./2022_07/README.md) - This contains the installation guide for version `0.8.15` from a commit in July 2022.
* [2022_11](./2022_11/README.md) - This contains the installation guide for version `0.9.1` from a commit in November 2022.
* [2023_03](./2023_03/README.md) - This contains the installation guide for version `0.9.2` from a commit in March 2023.

## Outcome

These will result in a set of working versions of openpilot running on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine. They will both take in video and output steering angle, as seen below. See each of the readme's for more information:
