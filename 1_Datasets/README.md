# Datasets
To fully replicate the results, the comma.ai 2016, comma.ai 2k19, and JUtah datasets must be separately downloaded and set up.
These cannot be independently hosted due to licensing limitations.
Please reach out to one of the authors for information on how to obtain these datasets: `hildebrandt.carl@virginia.edu` or `adw8dm@virginia.edu`.
The main readme has more information on how to replicate the results from the paper using solely the outputs of the AV systems and the SUT.
