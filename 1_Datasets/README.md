# Datasets
To fully replicate the results, the comma.ai 2016, comma.ai 2k19, and JUtah datasets must be separately downloaded and set up.
These cannot be independently hosted due to licensing limitations.
More information on how to obtain these datasets will be made available in a future release due to anonymization concerns.
The main readme has more information on how to replicate the results from the paper using solely the outputs of the AV systems and the SUT.
