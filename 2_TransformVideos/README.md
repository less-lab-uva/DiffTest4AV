# Transforming data
In order for the AVs and SUTs set up in `0_Setup` to run on the datasets from `1_Datasets`, all of the input videos must be preprocessed into a common format.
This folder contains the scripts to handle this process. Each script must be run separately after the datasets are set up. See the README in `1_Datasets` for more information.
