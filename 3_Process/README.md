# Implementation
This folder contains the scripts to perform the analysis from the study. `OutlierDetection.py` contains the implementations of the stages of DiffTest4AV. 
The `cache` folder contains the data collected from the SUTs for the experiment; there is one `pkl` file for every video processed for 2096 files total.
Each of the other scripts generates a particular figure from the paper and is executed by calling `gen_figs.sh`. 
See the main README for more information.
